# SCT_ML_02 – Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Task Objective
To apply the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`)
- Visualized customer patterns based on Annual Income and Spending Score
- Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)
- Applied K-Means clustering to group customers
- Visualized the clusters for better understanding

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Output
- Identified distinct customer segments (e.g., High Income – Low Spending, Low Income – High Spending, etc.)
- Successfully visualized the clusters
- Helped understand customer profiles for targeted marketing

## 📚 What I Learned
- How unsupervised learning algorithms work
- Applying K-Means Clustering in real-world data
- Interpreting cluster visualizations
- The importance of feature selection and scaling
